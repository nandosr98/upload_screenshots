# upload_screenshots
Code made for Data4You to do screenshots and upload them to google drive

This is a programme to do screenshots to from some pages and then, upload them to google drive.

To run the programme you just need to execute the file caseStudy.php 
It is connected to an API of google drive and the API of screenshotmachine

If it doesn't work is because the email of the file credenciales.json is bad written.

The caseStudy.php file is the final programme.

This programme is separated in two files, the file uploadImages.php which shows how you can upload your images to googledrive and downloadImages.php which explain how to do a screenshot and download it.

This programme works with the library google-api-php-client-2.4.0 which has to be downloaded or installed in the same directory as the caseStudy.php
I enclose the link to download it
